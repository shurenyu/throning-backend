    <h2>Social Club Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Social Club Privacy Policy ("Policy")! This explains how we collect, store, protect, and share your information,
      and with whom we share it. We suggest you read this in conjunction with our brilliant
      <a href="/en-us/terms">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>. Whilst you're enjoying the Social Club mobile application ("App"), we collect some
      information about you. In addition, you may choose to use the App to share information with other Social Clubrs, including
      your friends and contacts ("Users"). We may also need to share your information sometimes. </p>
    <p>By downloading and installing our App, you agree that we can collect, transfer, store, disclose and use your information
      as described in this Policy. Social Club is a global app, and your information will be sent to and used in the United
      States regardless of the country you reside in, and by downloading our App you consent to such transfer. So please
      read very carefully!</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please feel free to contact us at
      <a href="mailto:feedback@team.Social Club.com">feedback@team.Social Club.com</a>.</p>
    <h2>1. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.</h2>
    <h3>Registration Information</h3>
    <p>When you download the App and create an account ("Account"), we may collect certain information ("Registration Information")
      about you, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name;</li>
      <li>Username;</li>
      <li>Email address;</li>
      <li>Mobile number;</li>
      <li>Gender identity;</li>
      <li>Date of birth;</li>
      <li>Sexual preference;</li>
      <li>Photographs;</li>
      <li>Location; and</li>
      <li>Login information and friend lists for social media accounts that you connect to your Social Club Account (this could
        include, for example, your Facebook and Instagram accounts ("Social Media Accounts").</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will also be required to create a password in connection with the registration of your Account. Once you register,
      you will be able to review and change this information at any time by accessing your “Profile” page! You control your
      user profile and are able to correct or update (other than your email address, mobile number, date of birth, gender
      and location (which is automatically updated)) your information at any time by just logging in to Social Club. </p>
    <p>The information we collect helps to enhance the App and verify our Users (Robots are not welcome!!). Registration Information
      such as your name and username may be visible to the public on your profile page. </p>
    <h3>Additional Information</h3>
    <p>We may ask you to provide your full name, address and email address. You agree that such details may be shared with third
      parties for purposes relating to, for example, any of our loyalty programs, sending gifts or delivery of merchandise.</p>
    <p>We may also collect additional information in connection with your use of Social Club, for example if you use our super
      cool electronic messaging function.</p>
    <p>If you contact our Customer Support team, we will receive your email address, and may track your IP address as well as
      the information you send to us to help resolve your query. We will keep records of our communications with you, including
      any complaints that we receive from you about other Users (and from other Users about you).</p>
    <p>We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself.
      We also do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or
      addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers' licence details and other sensitive information
      on your profile which is open to abuse and misuse.</p>
    <p>Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such as your religious denomination
      and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, including
      your sexual preferences, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs that you post on Social
      Club may reveal information about yourself as well. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information
      about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing of your information and making this public to other
      users.
    </p>
    <p>When you post information about yourself or use the messaging function, the amount of personal information you share
      is at your own risk. Please see Section 4 below for more information on who can access what you post on Social Club.
      If you post anything that is inconsistent with our Terms and Conditions of Use, we reserve the right to terminate your
      Account - we really don't want to have to do this so please play by the rules!</p>
    <p>For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user experience, we require users to verify their accounts
      and might ask for your phone number. We want to make sure you are not a robot! And we also want to avoid fake Social
      Club accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the Social Club
      network and spoil things for everyone. We use a third party provider for account verification who will keep your phone
      number for up to 90 days for fraud identification purposes across a range of online platforms and services like Social
      Club’s. We collect and use your phone number on the basis of our legitimate interests identified above and for the
      prevention of fraud.</p>

    <p>If you decide to purchase any of our premium services, we will process your payment information and retain this securely
      for the prevention of fraud and for audit/tax purposes. Under data protection law, it is necessary for us to collect
      and process this payment data to enable us to perform our contract with you and our ongoing retention of this data
      is justified by our legitimate interests set out above.</p>

    <p>Finally, we want to keep in touch with you to make sure you know about the great promotions and offers we have available.
      If you’ve told us it’s OK, we will use your email address and phone number to send you information on these. You can
      withdraw this consent at any time via Settings in the app.</p>
    <h3>Data Storage</h3>
    <p>By using the App, you agree and acknowledge that Social Club is a global app operating through servers located in a number
      of countries around the world, including the United States. If you live in a country with data protection laws, the
      storage of your personal data may not provide you with the same protections as you enjoy in your country of residence.
      By submitting your personal information, or by choosing to upgrade the services you use, or by making use of the applications
      available on Social Club, you agree to the transfer of your personal information to, and storage and processing of
      your personal information in, any such countries and destinations.</p>
    <h3>Geolocation Information</h3>
    <p>If you turn these features on, when you use your mobile, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well
      as other location information about your longitude and latitude and may save your device's coordinates to offer certain
      features to you. This information helps us identify your physical location and we may use it to personalize the App
      and make it easier for you to interact with other Users, by enabling the information to be displayed and shared with
      other members choosing to view “nearby” posts.</p>
    <p>If you have enabled location services, but wish to turn it off, you can do so by the following methods:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, Social Club</li>
      <li>Android — profile, privacy, off</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Log and Usage Data</h3>
    <p>Our servers automatically record information ("Log and Usage Data") created by your use of the Service, which again helps
      us to improve our service. Log and Usage Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, the referring
      domain, pages visited, access times, your mobile carrier, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with
      Social Club and advertisements, may also be included in Log and Usage Data.</p>
    <p>Where you request that your profile is deleted via the app, it is immediately made unavailable and fully deleted within
      30 days. Correspondence with our Customer Support team will be retained for longer to allow us to deal with any subsequent
      queries you may have but will usually be deleted within 6 years if there are no queries.</p>
    <p>Anonymised information about activity on Social Club is retained for longer for statistical and product research purposes
      but this is not attributable to an individual once the profile has been deleted.</p>
    <p>Information such as payment information, IP addresses, mobile numbers and email addresses are retained for anti-fraud
      and anti-spam purposes for as long as they are relevant. This is usually determined by the expiry of the payment method.</p>
    <h3>Device Information</h3>
    <p>We may collect information about your device when you use the App including the unique device identifier, device model,
      operating system, and MAC address. In addition, if you permit us to do so, the App may access your device's address
      book solely in order to add someone to your contacts.</p>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>We may keep track of how you interact with links available on Social Club including third party services and clients
      by redirecting clicks or through other means. We may share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular
      link was clicked on. </p>
    <h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
    <p>Unlike the chocolate chip kind, these cookies have no calories! They are small data files that are transferred to your
      computer's hard disk and are basically a tool that stores information about website visits, recognises you and your
      preferences each time you visit Social Club, and ensures site functionality and enables us to provide the services
      our members request.</p>

    <p>Social Club’s use of cookies and local storage devices is basically related to the performance of Social Club’s site,

      be able to access all of the features Social Club offers! </p>

    <h2>2. USE OF INFORMATION.</h2>
    <p>Our main goal is to ensure your experience on Social Club is an enjoyable one and you don't end up getting stung! In
      order to deliver an enjoyable experience to you, we may use your Registration and other information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>offer you our services and features;</li>
      <li>contact you with information about the App (e.g., updates and new offerings);</li>
      <li>personalize the App and the content we deliver to you;</li>
      <li>conduct research and analytics about how you use and interact with the App; </li>
      <li>resolve disputes between you and other Users; and</li>
      <li>investigate fraud, protect our legal rights, and to enforce our Terms & Conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.</h2>
    <p>Our policy is to not disclose your Registration Information, except in the limited circumstances described here:</p>
    <p>
      <b>Your Consent</b> – If you consent, we may share or disclose your Registration Information, such as when you use a third
      party web client or application to access your Account.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Service Providers</b> - We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us. We
      may share your Registration Information with these third parties, but only for the purposes of performing these functions
      and providing such services e.g. information technology companies (hardware and software) which provide services to
      support our products.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Moderators</b> – To monitor activity on the apps and approve content.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Payment Processing and Telecommunications Companies</b> – To facilitate payments for our premium services.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Law and Harm</b> - As we mentioned in the
      <a href="/en-us/terms">Terms & Conditions</a>, we think it is very important that all Social Clubrs behave whilst using the App. We will cooperate
      with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights. We will also cooperate with law enforcement
      enquiries from within or outside your country of residence where we are required to by law or to protect the vital
      interests of a person. This may include preserving or disclosing any of your information, including your Registration
      Information, if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with a law or regulation, or when we believe
      that disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal request; to protect the safety
      of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues e.g. through anti-spam providers to protect the service
      from criminal activity or to protect our rights or property or those of third parties. In such cases we may raise or
      waive any legal objection or right available to us.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Business Transfers</b> -In the event that Social Club or any of our affiliates undergoes a business transition or change
      of ownership, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, re-organisation, or sale of all or a portion of its
      assets, or in the event of insolvency or administration, we may be required to disclose your personal data.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Aggregated Information</b> – We may share aggregated information with third parties that includes your personal data
      (but which doesn’t identify you directly) together with other information including log data for industry analysis
      and demographic profiling. You may opt-out of receiving marketing messages by using the opt-out mechanisms and links
      provided in each email.</p>

    <p>We ensure these parties must adhere to strict data protection and confidentiality provisions that are consistent with
      this Policy. Measures are taken to ensure that the data shared is non-attributable to the greatest extent possible.</p>
    <h2>4. WHAT OTHERS MAY SEE ABOUT YOU.</h2>
    <p>We think our Social Clubrs are awesome, and we want you to share how awesome you are with the world, so we have built
      certain features to enable this. Our App is designed to make it easier for you to connect with other Users and to interact
      with them. If you register or login to the App using your Facebook account, you are authorizing us to access certain
      Facebook account information, including information you make available via Facebook, your friends list, current location
      and those friends you have in common with other Social Clubrs. You also understand that your Social Club profile and
      other information you make available via the App, including information you provide directly or indirectly through
      Facebook (i.e., your Facebook photos, your name, age, approximate location, friends you have in common with other Social
      Clubrs and other profile information), may be viewed and shared by Social Clubrs with individuals who may or may not
      be Users or via third party applications in such Social Clubrs’ discretion. For example, a User may recommend you as
      a match to his or her Facebook friends by sharing your picture, regardless of whether such friend(s) is also a User
      of the App. You might share information like the photos and messages you send or upload and any metadata provided with
      those messages, along with any comments or information you provide in connection with your photos.</p>
    <p>When using Social Club, you should assume that
      <b>anything</b> you post or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users of the App and non-Users
      of the App. We want our Social Clubrs to be careful about posting information that will eventually be made public.</p>
    <h2>5. MODIFYING YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION.</h2>
    <p>You may access or modify the Registration Information you provided at anytime or permanently delete your Account (although
      we really hope you don't!) </p>
    <p>When your Account is deactivated, we take reasonable efforts to make sure it is no longer viewable on the App. For up
      to 30 days it is still possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After 30
      days, we begin the process of deleting your Account from our systems. We are not responsible for any information, pictures,
      comments, or other content that is deleted from our systems resulting from the deactivation of your Account.</p>
    <p>To prevent abuse and/or misuse of Social Club by a User following termination or deletion of a profile/Account we shall
      retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that User does not open a new
      Account and profile in breach of our
      <a href="/en-us/terms">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Warning</b>: Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your Account, copies of that information
      may still be viewable and/or accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied
      or stored by other Users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this,
      nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal
      information they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.</p>
    <p>Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 30 days to enable restoration, but will not be
      available to others in the meantime.</p>
    <h2>6. OUR POLICY TOWARDS AGE.</h2>
    <p>Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you have to be at least 18 years old to use the App
      - sorry kids, we know Social Club is cool, but you'll have to come back when you're old enough! </p>
    <p>Social Club does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors or anyone under the age of
      18. If you are less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that
      a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will
      take steps to terminate that person's registration and delete their Registration Information from Social Club. If we
      do delete a profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that
      you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new profile.</p>
    <h2>7. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY.</h2>
    <p>As Social Club evolves, we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will
      govern our use of your information and will always be at
      <a href="/en-us/privacy">Social Club.com/privacy/</a>. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will
      notify you, for example, via an email to the email associated with your Account or by posting a notice within Social
      Club. By continuing to access or use the App after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised
      Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h2>8. SECURITY.</h2>
    <p>Here at Social Club we pride ourselves on taking commercially reasonable security measures to help protect your information
      against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, or disclosure. We use reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality
      of your personal information such as secured servers using firewalls. </p>
    <p>Unfortunately no website or Internet transmission is ever completely 100% secure and even we cannot guarantee that unauthorised
      access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur, but here are some handy tips to help keep your data
      secure:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Please make sure you log out of your Account after use as you never know who may stumble onto your Account!</li>
      <li>Please don't share your social media password with anyone else! </li>
      <li>Change your social media password periodically.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you ever think someone has had access to your social media password, please report it to the relevant social media
      platform and change your password immediately. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being
      transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.</p>
    <p>
      <b>WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACHES OF SECURITY,
        DAMAGE TO YOUR DEVICE, OR ANY LOSS OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION OR OTHER DATA.</b>
    </p>
    <h2>9. THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS.</h2>
    <p>If you have registered with Social Club using a third party social media platform, such as Facebook, your Social Club
      profile will be available to all Users of Social Club whether via our App or our partners' websites.</p>
    <p>Remember that when you register with a third party, you are also giving them personal information, so we recommend that
      you read their privacy policies as Social Club does not control how they use their information.</p>
    <p>If you have registered on one of these third party websites, such as Facebook, or you have verified your Account via
      a third party website, we may connect your Social Club profile with your profile on such website. We may do this by
      way of new products and applications which we introduce from time to time, including new products powered by our group
      companies.
    </p>
    <p>If you have created a Social Club profile through a third party website and you do not want to link your Social Club
      profile to your profile on the third party website, Social Club cannot amend these settings. Please visit the application
      settings on your third party website profile and follow the instructions to remove the Social Club access permissions.</p>
    <p>We only use the APIs, OAuth Tokens, Widgets, or other means provided by the applicable Social Media Account to integrate
      your Social Media Account with our App. As such, we only receive the limited information that each Social Media Account
      permits to be transferred.</p>
    <h2>10. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.</h2>
    <p>California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from
      California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties
      for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. If you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California
      Civil Code section 1798.83, you can write to us at
      <a href="mailto:feedback@team.Social Club.com">feedback@team.Social Club.com</a>.</p>
    <p>From time to time we may disclose your contact information to third parties to allow them to market their products or
      services to you or for other marketing purposes. This may be information we received from you offline and online. If
      you want us to stop further sharing your email contact information with third parties (if we have your email contact
      information), you may notify us at
      <a href="mailto:feedback@team.Social Club.com">feedback@team.Social Club.com</a>. Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from
      their messages. If you have opted-out as described above, and thereafter you chose to use a service or promotion that
      requires us to contact you or share your information with a third party, then your previous opt-out preferences will
      not apply to such service. </p>
    <p>In addition, under California law, operators of online services are required to disclose how they respond to "do not
      track" signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection
      of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party online services, to the extent the operator
      engages in that collection. At this time, we do not track our Users' personal information over time and across third-party
      online services. This law also requires operators of online services to disclose whether third parties may collect
      personal information about their users' online activities over time and across different online services when the users
      use the operator's service. We do not knowingly permit third parties to collect personal information about an individual
      User's online activities over time and across different online services when using the App.</p>
    <h2>11. YOUR UK AND EU RIGHTS.</h2>

    <p>Under UK and EU law, UK and EU users have the right to lodge a complaint with data protection regulators, and the Information

    <b>How does Social Club protect my personal data?</b>
    <p>Social Club has implemented appropriate security measures to protect and prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of
      the information under our control, including your personal data. Our technical experts at Social Club work hard to
      ensure your secure use of our site.</p>
    <p>While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our website, member database and records no
      website or Internet transmission is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data
      loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal data safe (including your
      password) and to log out of your account after use. If you lose your password or give it out, or another service provider
      that you use suffers a data breach and you have used the same credentials with that service provider as you have with
      Social Club, your personal data may be compromised. If that happens, please report it to Support via

    <b>Where is my personal data kept?</b>
    <p>We want you to be able to access Social Club wherever you happen to be in the world. To enable us to provide that service,
      we operate a global network of servers including in the US, Hong Kong, Czech Republic and Russia. The hardware is located
      in third-party data centres but is owned by the Social Club group. Data collected by advertising partners may also
      be held outside the European Economic Area. We ensure that the data is adequately protected by ensuring that valid,
      legal mechanisms are in place such as: EU approved model clauses (which can be found
      <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en">here</a>), US privacy shield certification (more information can be found
